# What is Clank-Jekyll?

Clank-Jekyll is a starter project for prototyping apps with [Clank](http://getclank.com) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

## Why this?

This repository provides a way to prototype efficiently with Clank.

Clank in itself is a HTML/CSS component framework.

This repository provides a starter project to create prototypes.

It's the initial Clank author's preferred method for prototyping Clank-based apps.

However, it has a few dependencies (notably Jekyll) and a steeper learning curve (requires npm, grunt, git, ruby gems and bower knowledge) than Clank, which is why it lives in a separate repository.

## Setup

To set Clank-Jekyll up run:

    npm install
    bower install
    grunt watch

Make sure you have installed node JS, bower and Grunt.

You will also need to have the Jekyll, Sass and Compass ruby gems on your system. Install them through [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/):

    gem install jekyll
    gem install sass
    gem install compass
